/*
* This page simulates the "view flightplan" area of your dispatch system. This should be where
* you have the API redirect your pilots when the flight plan has been generated. 
*
* To be able to receive the OFP data sent back from the SimBrief system, we must first include
* the SimBrief API class.
*/

include 'simbrief.apiv1.php';



/*
* And that's it! If the API redirected you to this page, it should have appended a 
* "?ofp_id=" parameter to the end of the page url. The SimBrief API will look for this parameter,
* and if it's present, will load the flightplan data into the $simbrief object. You can then
* load this data into your Dispatch System in any way you wish. The sky's the limit!
*
* It should be noted that the data files associated with generated flight plans only remain on
* the SimBrief server for a short time (less than a day), so if you would like the flight plan
* to remain available to your users for longer than that, I recommend programming your system to
* save the data locally on your own server for future use.
*
* Below I will simply var_dump the $simbrief variable to display the returned data. The variable
* contains the following data:
*
* $simbrief->ofp_id returns the OFP datafile to be fetched, as specified in the page URL
* $simbrief->ofp_avail returns whether flightplan data was loaded successfully (true/false)
* $simbrief->ofp_obj returns the data as a PHP SimpleXML Object
* $simbrief->ofp_rawxml returns the raw XML string of the data
* $simbrief->ofp_json returns the data as a JSON Object
* $simbrief->ofp_array returns the data as a standard PHP Array
*/


$xmllink = $_GET['ofp_id'];
